# Tuition anomaly audit — `tui_trend` downward-jump scan (workbook cross-referenced)

Scan of all 208 schools' resident `tui_trend` for year-over-year drops **> 10%**
and **>= $2,000** (real tuition rarely falls that fast). Each flag is now
cross-referenced against the **authoritative `Exhibit_Data.xlsx`** (column `ABA src`),
so you can adjudicate case by case. **Nothing was auto-changed.** Tell me which to
patch and I'll edit `tui_trend` (+ `nrt` mirrors) and rebuild.

Last refreshed 2026-06-05 against the uploaded workbook. 51 downward jumps flagged.

## Patched in v1.51.2 (decisive cases only)

Corrected to the ABA source where the evidence was unambiguous (isolated 2x
spike bracketed by correct years on both sides, scalar-confirmed, or 0-sentinel):

- Cornell 2019 res $135,496 -> $67,748 (isolated spike)
- Ohio State 2019 res $62,900 -> $31,450 (isolated spike)
- Campbell 2019 res $85,200 -> $42,600 (isolated spike)
- Nevada-Las Vegas 2020 res $53,800 -> $26,900, nr $78,600 -> $39,300 (isolated spike)
- Montana 2023-25 res $12k -> $19,494 / $24,161 / $24,582 (matches the school's own 2025 scalar)
- Florida State 2020-22 res & nr were 0-sentinels -> ABA ($17,487/$17,487/$17,458; nr $35,902/$35,902/$35,873)

The remaining flags below are LEFT AS-IS: they are genuine semester-vs-annual
ambiguities where the direction varies by school (for several, the site value
already fits the trajectory and the ABA cell is the per-semester figure).
Verify these against the original 509 disclosure before changing.



## D. Likely SITE error — ABA source has a normal/higher value (best fix candidates)

| School | Year | Site prev → year | Drop | ABA src (prev → year) | Assessment |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Montana, University of | 2023 | $14,838 → $12,263 | −17% | $14,838 → $19,494 | site below ABA source — likely site error; ABA = $19,494 |
